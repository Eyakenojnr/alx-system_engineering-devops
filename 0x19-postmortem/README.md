# POSTMORTEM

Upon the release of ALX's System Engineering & DevOps project `0x19. Postmortem`,
approximately 13:16 West African Time (WAT) here in Nigeria, an outage occurred on an isolated
Ubuntu 14.04 container running an Apache web server. `GET` requests on the server led to
`500 Internal Server Error`'s, when the expected response was an HTML file defining a
simple Holberton WordPress site.

## Debugging Process

Bug debugger Niyi (Neyo... as in my actual initials... made that up on the spot, pretty
good, huh?) encountered the issue upon opening the project and being, well, instructed to
address it, roughly 14:00 WAT. He promptly proceeded to undergo solving the problem.

1. Checked running processes using `ps aux`. Two `apache2` processes - `root` and `www-data` -
were properly running.

2. Looked in the `sites-available` folder of the `/etc/apache2/` directory. Determined that
the web server was serving content located in `/var/www/html/`.

3. In one terminal, ran `strace` on the PID of the `root` Apache process. In another, curled
the server. Expecting great things... only to be disappointed. `strace` gave no useful
information.

4. Repeated step 3, except on the PID of the `www-data` process. Kept expectations lower this
time... but was rewarded! `strace` revelead an `-1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)` error
occurring upon an attempt to access the file `/var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp`.

5. Looked through files in the `/var/www/html/` directory one-by-one, using Vim pattern
matching to try and locate the erroneous `.phpp` file extension. Located it in the
`wp-settings.php` file. (Line 137, `require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.php' );`).

6. Removed the trailing `p` from the line.

7. Tested another `curl` on the server. 200 A-ok!

8. Wrote a Puppet manifest to automate fixing of the error.

## Summation

In short, a typo. Gotta love'em. In full, the WordPress app was encountering a critical
error in `wp-settings.php` when tyring to load the file `class-wp-locale.phpp`. The correct
file name, located in the `wp-content` directory of the application folder, was
`class-wp-locale.php`.

Patch involved a simple fix on the typo, removing the trailing `p`.

## Prevention

This outage was not a web server error, but an application error. To prevent such outages
moving forward, please keep the following in mind.

* Test! Test test test. Test the application before deploying. This error would have arisen
and could have been addressed earlier had the app been tested.

* Status monitoring. Enable some uptime-monitoring service such as
[UptimeRobot](./https://uptimerobot.com/) to alert instantly upon outage of the website.

Note that in response to this error, a Puppet manifest
[0-strace_is_your_friend.pp](https://github.com/bdbaraban/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x17-web_stack_debugging_3/0-strace_is_your_friend.pp)
 was written to automate fixing of any such identitical errors should they occur in the future. The manifest
replaces any `phpp` extensions in the file `/var/www/html/wp-settings.php` with `php`.

But of course, it will never occur again, because we're programmers, and we never make
errors! (do we?) :wink:

# Background Context
Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

- To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
- And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
